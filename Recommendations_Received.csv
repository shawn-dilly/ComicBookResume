Brad,Artman,PeopleReady,Director of Branch Technology,"I’ve had the opportunity to work with Shawn across multiple companies, and he’s consistently been someone I genuinely enjoy collaborating with. He’s highly motivated and brings a strong sense of ownership to everything he works on.  Shawn has exceptional knowledge across a wide technical stack, but what really sets him apart is his ability to communicate complex ideas clearly—whether he’s talking with engineers, product teams, or leadership. He meets people where they are and keeps conversations productive and aligned.  He’s also great at taking an idea and quickly moving it into a clear, actionable concept. Add to that his adaptability in fast-changing environments, and you have someone who can thrive no matter the challenge. Shawn is a huge asset to any team, and I’d happily work with him again.","01/26/26, 10:58 PM",VISIBLE
Michael,"Walsh, MBA",PeopleReady,Director Program Management," I’ve had the privilege of working with Shawn at two different companies, and he is a proven technical leader with a strong ability to set clear strategic and technical direction. He is deeply focused on ensuring his teams deliver high-quality work and do so on time. Shawn consistently puts himself in positions that demand accountability, and he delivers on that accountability time and time again.","01/26/26, 09:22 PM",VISIBLE
Carlos Aaron,Bocanegra Buitron,HatchWorks AI,Senior Full Stack Developer,"I highly recommend Shawn, and I feel genuinely fortunate to have worked with him as part of his development team on the Reimagine 2.0 project in TrueBlue.  As our manager, he led the engineering team with clarity and consistency, partnered closely with the Product team to plan and align priorities, and managed conflicts and dependencies with other teams in a constructive and effective way. One thing I will always appreciate is how he handled the project’s challenges without letting the pressure spill onto the team. He created a stable, focused environment where we could keep delivering with confidence while also taking on many other responsibilities behind the scenes that I’m sure I wasn’t fully aware of. Shawn is also an outstanding technical leader with deep expertise in cloud architecture, software development, CI/CD, and databases. He was instrumental in resolving deployment issues, leading database performance reviews and improvements, and translating Product requirements into practical, feasible solutions—while still guiding the team with strong ownership and direction. A great leader and an even better person. I would gladly work with Shawn again and recommend him for any engineering or technical leadership role.","01/26/26, 08:51 PM",VISIBLE
Christopher,Brown,Simplify Healthcare,Director of Quality Assurance,"As the Director of Quality Assurance, I frequently interacted with the Development Staff.  Over the course of my time at Healthation, Shawn and I had the opportunity to work on several projects together.  I watched Shawn grow into a nose down coder into a true developer and professional. Shawn was able to convert Quality Assurance needs into viable solutions, he did not require written requirements, he understood the intent and the end goal. Shawn created a deployment tool that saved several departments time and frustration.  Throughout the process of creation and deployment of this tool, he constantly asked for feedback, and once received he was again able to modify the tool accordingly with ease. Shawn was always eager to learn and looked at feedback as an opportunity, not criticism. I have no doubt that Shawn's professionalism and ability to learn will serve him well in the future.","06/01/13, 03:50 PM",VISIBLE
Adam,Gojdas,PLZ Corp,Principal Application Developer,I worked with Shawn when he was right out of college.  He was very eager to get involved with all aspects of our development group and had a great understanding of software development from the get go.  He was able to quickly get up to speed and contribute in his development role.  Many of the duties I had were transitioned to him as a backup to my position which he was able to successfully handle and then improve upon.  Shawn can bring a fresh perspective to many tasks.  Shawn worked hard to deliver while I was there and it appears he has continued to do so.  I am certain he will see success throughout his career and be of great value to any company.,"03/19/13, 02:18 PM",VISIBLE
